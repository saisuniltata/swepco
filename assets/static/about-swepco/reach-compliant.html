<p>What is REACH?</p>
<p>Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) is a European Union Regulation that addresses the production and use of chemical substances, and their potential impacts on both human health and the environment.</p>
<p>REACH is designed to achieve the following:</p>
<p>
</p><ul>
<li>Registration of basic information on chemical substances submitted by companies to a central database</li>
<li>Evaluation of the registered information to determine hazards and risks</li>
<li>Authorisation requirements imposed on the use of high-concern substances</li>
<li>Restriction of a substanceâ€™s use if it poses an unacceptable risk to health or the environment</li>
<p></p>
</ul><p>In achieving these objectives, REACH hopes to have these positive affects:<br />
<ul><li>To protect human health and the environment from the use of chemicals</li>
<li>To make European manufacturers and importers responsible for understanding and managing the risks associated with the chemicals they place on the EU market</li>
<li>To allow the free movement of substances on the EU market</li>
<li>To enhance innovation and competition in the EU chemicals industry</li>
<li>To promote the use of alternative methods for assessing hazardous properties of substances</li>
</ul><p></p>
