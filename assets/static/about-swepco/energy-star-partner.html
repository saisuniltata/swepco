<p><strong>Since 1933, Southwestern Petroleum Corporation’s SWEPCO Brand Lubricants have been saving our Customers energy through state-of-the-art anti-friction chemistry. Now, we are pleased to recognized as an Energy Star® Partner with the United States Department of Energy &amp; Environmental Protection Agency.</strong></p>
<p><!--break--></p><p><strong><big>HOW FRICTION COSTS US ALL MONEY ?</big></strong></p>
<p><!--break--></p><p>It is simple really. Electrical energy applied to a task is split between the work that is done and the energy lost to friction in the form of heat.<strong> The goal of a lubricant is to reduce the ratio of friction to work</strong>.</p>
<p><strong><big>WHAT CAN YOU DO ABOUT IT?</big></strong></p>
<p><!--break--></p><p>The truth is that not all oils are the same; nor are all greases. There are important differences in oil base stocks, additive chemistry and formulation technology. And<strong> your choice of lubricant has a direct impact on your energy use</strong>. The ability of SWEPCO Lubricants to reduce friction and energy consumption has been proven in a wide range of demanding applications around the globe.</p>
<p>Our Energy Star® Partner status helps establish our credibility in this important area. From reducing amperage loads on heavily loaded gear boxes ... to supplying more economical plant compressed air ... to reduced drag on extruders, chain drives, pumps, mills and crushers ... to improving fuel economy in over-the road and off-road diesel applications ... <strong>SWEPCO’s Energy Saving Lubricants have proven they can reduce energy requirements as much as 4-12% or more</strong> in common, real-world applications.</p>
<p>As SWEPCO Lubricants reduce the friction that increases energy consumption, they also<strong> reduce the wear that shortens equipment life</strong>. So you get the added benefit of lower maintenance and repair costs and longer equipment life. And because SWEPCO Brand Lubricants deliver drain and re-greasing intervals that are typically three to five times longer than conventional lubricants,<strong> they save the environment too</strong>.</p>
