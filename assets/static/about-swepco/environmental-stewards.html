		<p>Like our customers, we care about our planet and strive to protect it by:</p>
		<p>
			<ol>
				<li>Reducing waste oil disposal; our products last longer so there is less used oil for disposal.</li>
				<li>Reducing energy consumption through our specialty lubricants that reduce friction. And we are proud to be the only Lubricant Manufacturer in the world that is recognized as an Energy Star Partner.</li>
				<li>Reducing soil contamination through our line of readily biodegradable lubricants that will not harm the environment.</li>
				<li>Reducing lubricant packaging disposal … drums, pails and tubes. Our customers buy and use less lubricants and grease each year and therefore have less used packing disposal.</li>
			</ol>
			<p></p>Together we take pride in making a positive impact on the environment and doing our part to reduce the world’s carbon footprint. </p>
