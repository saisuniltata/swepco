</ul><p><strong>SWEPCO 729 </strong>Premium Flushing Oil is a light mineral oil especially formulated for purging oil systems before switching to a SWEPCO High Performance Lubricant. Use of <strong>SWEPCO 729</strong> helps insure optimum performance from any SWEPCO Compressor Oil, Transmission Fluid, Hydraulic Fluid, Industrial Oil, Gear Oil or Engine Oil. Simply draining old lubricants does not entirely remove the old lubricant from the system. Intricate oil passages, reservoirs, fluid lines, cylinders, accumulators, pumps, separators, coolers and other oil system components can retain residual oil that can contaminate new SWEPCO Lubricants. A brief flushing cycle with<strong> SWEPCO 729 </strong>insures more complete elimination of old lubricants from the entire system. This is especially critical in compressor changeovers. It also removes loose deposits so they will not have a negative effect on compressor efficiency or operation.</p>
