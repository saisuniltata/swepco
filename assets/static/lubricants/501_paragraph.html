At the same time it fights the most common problems associated with diesel fuel . . . sludging, oxidation, corrosion, icing and the abrasive effects of ultra low sulfur fuel. The result is cleaner engines and fuel systems, longer injector and injector pump life, better performance, lower emission levels, lower maintenance costs and improved fuel economy. <strong><ins>FEATURES </ins></strong></p>
<ul><li>Increases cetane number of any diesel fuel for quicker, smoother, quieter, more complete combustion</li>
<li>Up to 42% cleaner exhaust emissions when measured by the opacity method</li>
<li>Keeps injectors clean...even cleans up dirty injectors</li>
<li>Reduces injector &amp; injector pump wear caused by today's abrasive low sulfur fuels by as much as 26%</li>
<li>Improves cold weather performance...lowers cold start temperatures &amp; reduces warm-up time</li>
<li>Reduces smoking, misfiring, &amp; knocking</li>
</ul><p><em>Description &amp; Purpose </em>SWEPCO 501 Premium Diesel Fuel Improver is a highly effective multi-function diesel fuel additive. Besides improving lubricity and controlling combustion deposits, it increases the cetane number of any diesel fuel. Increased cetane numbers result in improved combustion, lower emission levels and better cold weather operability. A special Winter Formula also provides protection from cold weather diesel fuel gelling problems.</p>
