<ul><li>Reduced wear and excellent resistance to water and corrosion</li>
<li>Clings tenaciously to metal, increasing the level of protection and reducing sling off and consumption</li>
<li>Stays on gear teeth longer, provides more protection from rust and extends lubrication intervals</li>
<li>Reduce or eliminate the need for periodic cleaning of build-up on shrouds and shields</li>
<li>Longer application intervals or reduced spray volume</li>
<li>Reduced used lubricant disposal costs</li>
<li>Wider application flexibility</li>
<li>extremely high viscosity film for gear protection</li>
