Its carrier agent evaporates almost instantly, leaving the remaining “dry’’ lubrication. <strong>Superior lubrication - </strong>- SWEPCO 812 is formulated with Moly, the best lubricant available. In addition, dirt and foreign particles cannot adhere to this lubricant; thus, better lubrication and less wear for surfaces exposed to such contaminants. It can be used at higher temperatures than conventional greases. And SWEPCO 812 outlasts ordinary lubricants. <strong>Won’t drip or run off - </strong>- SWEPCO 812 dry film means no waste or drippage. Saves money and time. <strong>All-purpose - </strong>- SWEPCO 812 is recommended anywhere conventional grease or oil is not desirable. For chains and sprockets, sliding surfaces, rollers and conveyors, door locks and hinges, and many other applications. <strong><ins>FEATURES </ins></strong></p>
