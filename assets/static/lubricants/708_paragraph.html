Industrial and turbine equipment manufacturers agree: sludge, varnish and carbon deposits resulting from oxidation of the oil are the number one cause of equipement operation inefficiencies and failure. </p>
<p>SWEPCO 708 is specifically designed to combat friction and wear resulting from high temperatures (oxidation), water, contaminants and heavy loads... providing much longer equipment and oil life. With lower operating temperatures, equipment using 708 will experience longer lasting, improved pliability of seals resulting in less oil leakage and less oil consumption.</p>
