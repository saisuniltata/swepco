</ul><p><strong>SWEPCO 201 Multi-Purpose Gear Lube</strong> is a premium quality, gear oil formulated to provide superior performance in a wide range of demanding operating conditions. It provides outstanding wear control, service life, cleanliness, thermal stability and corrosion resistance for most industrial gear boxes, manual transmissions, final drives and power take off units. It is blended from the finest high VI paraffinic base stocks available and the most advanced additive chemistry, including LUBIUM®, SWEPCO’s highly effective anti-wear additive. Outstanding lubricity and film strength reduce friction, wear and operating temperatures of heavily loaded gear boxes. Longer drain intervals, reduced waste oil, longer equipment and part life, less labor, more uptime and significant energy reduction are some of the important benefits provided by <strong>SWEPCO 201</strong>.</p>
