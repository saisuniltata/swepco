The problem is most of the popular hand cleaners are solvent-based and can cause skin dryness, irritation, burning of cuts and dermatitis. SWEPCO Pro-Scrub Hand Cleaner is different. It is a detergent based hand cleaner that is ph balanced and includes highly effective skin softener, anti-bacterial and anti-fungal ingredients. And,instead of using pumice or walnut shells that can be abrasive to skin, Pro-Scrub uses special polymer micro beads that are soft, pliable and not abrasive to skin. <strong><ins>FEATURES </ins></strong></p>
