Compressor manufacturers agree: sludge, varnish and carbon deposits resulting from oxidation of the oil is the number one cause of compressor inefficiencies and failure. <strong>SWEPCO 702 </strong>is formulated to combat friction and wear that result from high temperatures, water, contaminants and heavy loads...providing much longer equipment and oil life. Lower operating temperatures also extend seal life and reduce oil leakage and consumption. <strong><ins>FEATURES </ins></strong></p>
