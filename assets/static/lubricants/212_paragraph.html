It is ideal for trucking and other applications exposed to both cold and hot weather, such as open pit mines, quarries, oil field service, sand and gravel operations and other demanding applications. <strong>SWEPCO 212 </strong>provides unexcelled protection and reliability for both stationary gearboxes and heavy-duty mobile manual transmissions, final drives and transfer cases. Safe, long term protection from wear, friction, oxidation, sludge, varnish and corrosion are the result of a uniquely effective blend of the very finest base oil stocks and the latest lubrication additive chemistry, including SWEPCO’s special extreme pressure/anti-oxidant LUBIUM<sup>®</sup> and the extra anti-friction/anti-wear protection of technically fine molybdenum disulfide.</p>
