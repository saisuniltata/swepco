That’s why you need SWEPCO 803 Chain &amp; Cable Lubricant! It penetrates deep into links and strands to help to eliminate internal wear and friction, a major cause of cable and chain fatigue and failure. <strong>Contains graphite - </strong>SWEPCO 803 contains graphite which helps provide long lasting, superior lubrication of costly chain and cable installations. <strong>Even film lubrication plus deep penetration = no rust &amp; dirt - </strong>An even film lubrication over the entire chain or cable surface helps protect against rust and friction, which helps eliminate two of the most common causes of chain and cable failure. <strong><ins>FEATURES </ins></strong></p>
