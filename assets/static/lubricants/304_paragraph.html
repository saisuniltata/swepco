It is carefully balanced to exceed API CF quality performance and nonselective catalytic converter requirements. Changes in the natural gas engine industry have placed greater demands on engine oils and shifted the emphasis from ashless to ash-containing oils. These changes include stricter emission regulations, a growing number of 4-cycle engines and new engine designs. <strong>SWEPCO 304</strong> meets the challenge by offering unparalleled nitration and oxidation resistance, better piston deposit control and excellent scuff resistance for maximum engine and oil life. <strong><ins>FEATURES </ins></strong></p>
