<ul class="typo-bullet"><li>high heat resistance</li>
<li>cold temperature performance</li>
<li>friction reduction, wear control</li>
<li>oxidation resistance and service life</li>
</ul><p><strong>SWEPCO 102</strong> is an outstanding value for maintenance of equipment that requires superior protection at a more economical price. <b><big>Excels In High Heat Applications</big></b> <strong>SWEPCO 102</strong> is formulated with a suspension grade molybdenum-sulfur anti-friction compound (moly) that gives the base stock superior affinity for metal surfaces. This reduces friction well below levels encountered with conventional greases, significantly reducing heat and heat-related failures and providing corresponding increases in load carrying capability, operating efficiency and component life. <b><u>FEATURES</u></b></p>
<ul class="typo-bullet"><li>Non-melt grease with Molybdenum Dithophosphate (Liquid Moly) for less severe applications</li>
<li>Liquid Moly gives base stock exceptional affinity for metal without actually plating out lubricated surfaces like Moly powder</li>
<li>Heat and friction reducing properties are less than 101 Moly Grease, but much greater than conventional greases</li>
