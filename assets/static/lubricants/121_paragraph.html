It makes bearings run longer, cooler, smoother, quieter and more efficiently and increases both bearing life and equipment reliability. <b><big>WITH PROPRIETARY TRI-PLEX CHEMISTRY</big></b><big> </big><br /><strong>SWEPCO 121</strong> is a high performance grease based upon SWEPCO’s new, proprietary “Tri-Plex” chemistry ... an important advancement that produces a tighter molecular structure. This improvement and special polymer modification enhance a wide range of performance properties, including ... resistance to shearing, shock, high temperature oxidation, bleeding and water wash out. Combine enhanced performance in these critical areas with SWEPCO’s advanced EP performance, rust and corrosion protection and you have a new class of multi-service grease which lasts significantly longer and provides superior lubrication in the broadest possible range of applications. <b><u>FEATURES</u></b></p>
