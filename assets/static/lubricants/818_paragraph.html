Use it for loosening frozen and corroded bolts, nuts, screws, clamps and other threaded parts. Also good for pins, hinges, chains and other sliding or rubbing parts. Just spray it on and let it go to work dissolving and loosening rust, corrosion and crud of all kinds. Quick penetration means more work gets done with less wait time. And the clear formula means less clean-up. After disassembly and reassembly, spray parts to help prevent future rust and corrosion.</p>
