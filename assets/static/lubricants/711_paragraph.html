				<p>SWEPCO 711 is a fully synthetic, manual transmision lubrcant engineered to exceed the extended drain and OEM warranty requirements. SWEPCO 711 can be used year around in manual transmissions on light to severe duty, on-road and offroad equipment. SWEPCO 711 is designed to function in a wide range of environments and will provide maximum protection to heavy duty transmissions. SWEPCO 711 will outperform conventional gear oils with a wider operating temperature range, oxidation stability, wear protection and corrosion control capabilities. SWEPCO provides a stronger film strength at high temperatures due to its high viscosity index and excellent lubrication at below freezing without channeling. The outstanding performance of SWEPCO 711 makes it suitable for use in heavy duty long drain transmissions manufactured by Eaton and the Mack TO-A series. SWEPCO 711 meets or exceeds the requirements of the API, MT-1 EP gear oil classification and can be used in transmissions and gear cases requiring API Service GL-1 through GL-4.</p>
