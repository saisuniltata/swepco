</ul><p><strong>SWEPCO 305 Supreme Formula Engine Oil</strong> is a premium quality, multi-purpose, extended service engine oil specially formulated to provide superior performance under the most demanding operating conditions. Advanced chemistry provides outstanding wear control, service life, cleanliness, thermal stability and corrosion resistance for most diesel and gasoline engines. Carefully formulated SAE 30 and SAE40 grades deliver superior lubrication for applications which require uniform viscosity levels. <strong>SWEPCO 305</strong> is formulated from the very finest high VI 100% solvent refined paraffinic base stocks available and the most advanced additive chemistry, including DIMONYL<sup>®</sup>, SWEPCO’s proprietary anti-wear additive. Because SWEPCO Engine Oil provides superior performance for a longer period of time, <strong>SWEPCO 305</strong> saves money through overall reduced lubrication costs, including fuel conservation, reduction of waste, reduced maintenance costs and extension of equipment and oil life.</p>
